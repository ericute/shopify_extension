# Production Subscription app extension

Product subscription app extensions render UI that allows merchants to manage subscriptions as part of their normal workflow in the Shopify admin.

For more info, [read the docs](https://shopify.dev/tutorials/product-subscription-extension-overview).


### Local development

Run a local server:

```bash
# With npm
npm run server

# With yarn
yarn server
```

Your starting file is the index file in the root folder (either `index.js`, `index.ts`, or `index.tsx`).

### Build

Build a single minified JavaScript file containing your extension code:

```bash
# With npm
npm run build

# With yarn
yarn build
```
